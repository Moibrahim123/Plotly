## Background

Roza has a partially completed dashboard, but she needs to finish it. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Objectives

The goals of this challenge are for you to:
-	Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
-	Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
-	Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.

## Instructions

Continue working with the samples.json dataset, and complete the following tasks.
-	When an individual’s ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) should be visualized with a bar chart. Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
-	Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
-	Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
-	Use otu_labels as the hover text for the chart.
